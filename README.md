#MyCV

## what i did?

yes it's cv! by the way, my first ios cv application. so, don't be critical:)

nothing spe—Åial (who am I lying to), it is so much special app for me, so much. this task helped me to understand that i have chosen right direction. 

i created clear and pretty good looking app using constants, variables, table, buttons, if statements, bool expressions.
(having a limit of time) i have chosen variant - the simpler is the better.  only time will tell.
